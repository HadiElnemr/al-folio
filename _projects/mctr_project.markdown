   Our robot, "HAD" 
</div>
This is our wonderful mechatronics course project, where each group of students chose a feedback control system idea to implement. 
We chose to implement this idea after some search for ideas that are new to us to implement and that are also feasible.

The project needed a lot of time for implementing, tuning and debugging. 
We spent nights working on it and several hours solving issues, 
tuning the robot, modelling the system and simulating it.
I learnt a lot from my teammates and friends and I am glad that we had this great experience.
