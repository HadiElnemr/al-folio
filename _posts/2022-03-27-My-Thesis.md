My bachelor thesis topic's name is *Lane-level Map Matching for Model-scale Vehicles*, doing it at <a href='https://www.rwth-aachen.de/'>RWTH Aachen</a>, Germany.

This opportunity was provided by <a href='https://embedded.rwth-aachen.de/doku.php?id=en:lehrstuhl:mitarbeiter:alrifaee'>Dr.-Ing. Bassam Alrifae</a> and my work was supervised by <a href='https://embedded.rwth-aachen.de/doku.php?id=en:lehrstuhl:mitarbeiter:schaefer'>Simon Schäfer M.Sc.</a>, and the work is done under the <a href='https://embedded.rwth-aachen.de/doku.php?id=en:forschung:mobility'>Cyber-Physical Mobility Group</a>

The map matching problem arises in the field of autonomous vehicles where the position of a vehicle is obtained using GNSS sensors on the vehicle.
Like many types of sensors, GNSS data involves errors arising froom the idea of how satellites work to find the position of a moving vehicle.
Map matching a moving vehicle to an HD map using this distorted GNSS data is well known challenge.
Many algorithms where implemented and tested to address this specific problem.
An approach using Hidden Markov Model algorithm was implemented and tested by <a href ='https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1653771.1653818'>Newson and Krumm, 2009</a> which was successful and paved the road for many papers later that addressed this problem.
The work be Newson and Krumm is considered to be _road-level_ map matching.
In this thesis, the objective is to implement the HMM algorithm so support _lane-level_ map matching using GNSS data and data acquired by the vehicle itself such the heading, yaw rate etc.
